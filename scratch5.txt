now I would like to adjust all circle width to match their color.

right now functionA is populating the color and brightness
with filler values.

I think functionA should take an aditional, optional argument for an image.
If the image argument !null,
then get the brightness and rgb value from the first pixel.

hovering over a given cell should update the width and color of circGraph in each GraphsPanel object.

so i think hovering over a circle should update a global variable to the currentID.

all is good

hopefully everything is encapsulated enough so when I duplicate graphPanels and gridA, nothing leaks.
I think my odds are decent.

now i want to send the mouse to the center of each square
when it hovers over said square.

Let's first replace the mouse
