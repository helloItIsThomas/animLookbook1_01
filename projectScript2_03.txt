perhaps i should make a parentGrid that resizes itself to the current scope,
so I can always know how to position and size things.

Everything needs to be downstream of the parentGrid.

I think (???)
camAnim.z can perhaps be seen as the master zoom value?
and so whenever camAnim.z finishes changing,
parentGrid.update should be ran once?

now I need to be able to anticipate how the camera is going to act




i should make a function where when you call it,
it returns a flattened list of rectangles.
